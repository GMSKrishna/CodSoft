# CodSoft task->1
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. 
What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more. 
This is a classification project using Python and the Titanic data set. 
The goal was to use different machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers survived and compare the results to determine which algorithm is best suited for this problem.

# CodSoft task->2
A model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
Regression techniques are used to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. 
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. 
It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

# CodSoft task->3
Credit card fraud is a major concern for banks and financial institutions.
Fraudsters use various techniques to steal credit card information and make unauthorized transactions.
In this project, we will explore a dataset containing credit card transactions and build models to predict fraudulent transactions.
